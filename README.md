# Beer-Tag Web Application
![Beer-Tag Logo](/Screenshots/2-beertag-logo.png)

A web application with REST API for users to create and manager their own beers, as well as rate them, add them to wish & tasted-lists, and browse through all beers created by other users, and also use filtering & sorting. Users can edit or delete the beers they`ve created, as well as edit or delete their own profile. There is an admin role, which has its own Admin panel, which can edit or delete all beers and users.

***I would be happy to provide the code base upon request.***
