# Beer-Tag-Web-Application
A web application with REST API using Java with Thymeleaf and Spring Boot (with Spring MVC &amp; Spring Security). The front-end was built using a free CSS template that was additionally customized. Furthermore, I added a jQuery modal form that I also customized, and implemented AJAX requests on the sign-up form.
